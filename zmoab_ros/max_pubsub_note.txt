When making new project, and we need to use many pub/sub note.
We have to make our own custom.meta otherwise it will be limited as pub 10, sub 5

https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_platformio/issues/87#issuecomment-1354242266

put this on custom.meta on workspace directory
{
    "names": {
        "rmw_microxrcedds": {
            "cmake-args": [
                "-DRMW_UXRCE_MAX_NODES=1",
                "-DRMW_UXRCE_MAX_PUBLISHERS=15",
                "-DRMW_UXRCE_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS=15",
                "-DRMW_UXRCE_MAX_SERVICES=2",
                "-DRMW_UXRCE_MAX_CLIENTS=1",
                "-DRMW_UXRCE_MAX_HISTORY=4",
                "-DRMW_UXRCE_TRANSPORT=custom"
            ]
        }
    }
}

make sure to put the line below on platformio.ini

board_microros_user_meta = custom.meta

### If want to do it during project already made, then try change the name of 

[env:esp32s3devkitc] inside platformio.ini to something

Clean -> Build again
